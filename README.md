# A money-lending management system that uses React and Webpack

This is a project that uses webpack to transpile and bundle ES6 React code. To use, consider these steps:

To start the development server with a watcher that rebuilds your code, run `npm run dev`. The assets built by webpack are placed in `server/public`. This folder is defined as a static folder in an Express.js server.

Additional components are in `client/components`.
